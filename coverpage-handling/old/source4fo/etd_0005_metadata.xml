</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship  between coaches’ burnout, coaches’ behaviors, and levels of burnout and  satisfaction experienced by college athletes. The secondary purposes  were to examine how coaches’ levels of burnout were related to perceived  coaching behavior, and to examine the link between athletes’ levels of  burnout and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty two male and female coaches employed at the 8 public universities  in Jordan, and 413 male and female college athletes participated in this  study. The participants completed translated version of the Leadership  Scale for Sports (LSS; Chelladurai &amp; Saleh, 1980), Athlete Burnout  Questionnaire (ABQ; Raedeke &amp; Smith, 2001), Athlete Satisfaction  Questionnaire (ASQ; Riemer &amp; Chelladurai, 1998), and Maslach Burnout  Inventory-Educators Survey (Maslach, Jackson, &amp; Leiter, 1996). Data  were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson product-moment  correlation coefficients, and stepwise regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this study suggest that there is a significant  relationship between coaches’ leadership behaviors and burnout. It was  discovered that personal accomplishment and emotional exhaustion to be  significant predictors of the coaches’ leadership behaviors. Significant  relationships were found between perceived coaching behaviors and  athletes’ outcomes. Athletes who perceived their coaches as providing  more training and instruction, social support, feedback, and exhibiting  more democratic behavior and less autocratic behavior were more  satisfied and less burned out.  In addition, significant negative  relationships were found between athletes’ satisfaction and athletes’  burnout.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
