</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Decision-making is one of the most important elements in the  administration of any organization. University libraries are, of course,  organizations. Inside these organizations the managers make a variety  of decisions that will have a significant impact on the success of those  libraries. Libraries’ managers utilize different methods in processing  their decisions.  Many factors play roles in the success of libraries’  managers. The manager’s managerial decision style is one factor that  contributes to the success of the manager and therefore to the success  of their organization; and yet, there is a dearth of research about  decision styles used in library administration and how they influence  the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this study was to explore the managerial decision  styles of the managers (directors, associate directors, assistant  directors, and the heads of departments) of Florida’s state university  libraries. A second purpose was to determine the relation between the  variety of managers’ decision styles and the following seven variables:  gender, age, ethnicity, educational level, educational major,  administrative experience, and current position. The results of this  study will provide baseline information to improve our understanding of  library managers and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was grounded in the Decision Style Model developed  by Alan Rowe and Richard O. Mason (1987). A survey questionnaire was  employed in this study. The questionnaire included two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.	“The Decision Style Inventory”  (DSI) developed by Row and Mason  (1987). This inventory was applied to measure the decision styles of the  managers of Florida’s state university main libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.	The second part of the questionnaire consisted of questions designed  to obtain descriptive data such as gender, age, ethnicity, educational  level, educational major, current position, and administrative  experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Decision Style Model, it was found  that the predominant decision style for the majority of Florida’s state  university main libraries’ managers was the behavioral decision style,  followed by the conceptual decision style. The directive decision style  was the style used least often by most of these managers. As for the  decision style patterns, the findings inform us that the majority of  Florida’s state university main libraries’ managers think using the  right side of the brain rather than the left side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also found that there was no relationship was found between  Florida’s state university libraries’ managers and their gender, age, or  highest academic degree.  On the other hand, the findings of this study  indicated that years of administrative experience, ethnicity, position,  and educational major of these managers were indeed related to the  decision style or styles used by these managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date there has been no research conducted on profiling  the decision styles of Florida’s state university libraries’ managers  and the process of how they think in order to reach their decisions.  Given this, the results of this study provided baseline information to  improve our understanding of library managers and management in general  and in particular, understanding of library managers and management in  Florida’s state university libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
