</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Alcohol abuse is often considered a young person’s rite of passage and  part of the maturing process. Indeed, the developmental periods when  alcohol misuse and abuse are highest are those of adolescence and early  adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus for alcohol use research and funding over the years has been  with adolescent prevention and intervention. Because of this focus on  adolescents, little is being done to explore and to learn more about  adult use and adult entry into treatment. Since the average age of the  population is increasing, these attitudes toward alcohol use and treatment are no longer valid. Use,  misuse, and abuse of alcohol in adulthood, especially that leading to  addiction and then treatment, is a problem within the United States (US)  that merits careful attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this dissertation research is to investigate specific  aspects of entry into alcohol abuse treatment across stages of the life  course. The investigation used the sequential life course theory of  Levinson as the primary guiding theory and incorporated those aspects of Bronfenbrenner’s social  ecology theory used by Levinson. Specifically, with a population of approximately 94,000, this research examined the differences among  individuals who began alcohol abuse treatment in mid-life and who  experienced variations in time duration from the age of first use to the  age of first treatment. Additionally, this research evaluated the timing of treatment episodes in light of the  transitions within the life course as outlined by Levinson.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
