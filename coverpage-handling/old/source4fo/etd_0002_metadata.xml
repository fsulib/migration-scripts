</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Decentralization strategies have been applied widely in both developed  and developing countries. Previous research analyzes decentralization  from above by dealing with two aggregated levels of government: the  state and the local. Measures adopted by previous studies fail to  reflect the various dimensions of decentralization. They do not show how  decentralization is performed at the local level or whether local  governments are empowered and able to make independent decisions without  direct of indirect intervention from the central government. In this  research, I argue that local power over decision-making for  comprehensive planning reflects governmental decentralization and  captures its economic, political, and administrative dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research develops and tests a set of empirical measures of local  agency power over decision-making for comprehensive planning. The  measures analyze decentralization from below by investigating the extent  of agency power over decision-making for comprehensive planning at the  municipal level. It deals with local governments as disaggregated units,  which enables us to compare and trace levels of power over  decision-making across municipalities and over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major questions of the research are: what are empirical measures of  local agency power over decision-making for comprehensive planning? and  to what extent do proposed measures of local agency power succeed in  reflecting levels of governmental decentralization? Florida was selected  as the case study, because it has experienced&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xiii&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;changes in its governmental decentralization levels since the adoption  of its growth management system in the late 1960s. The unit of analysis  is a governmental planning agency within municipalities having 10,000 or  more inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Delphi study was conducted to develop measures of each major dimension  of local agency power over decision-making for comprehensive planning.  Dimensions of power include agency legal authority, relative autonomy,  control over local planning actions, and capacity to make planning  decisions. Agency capacity consists of four sub-dimensions: technical,  fiscal, institutional, and enforcement capacity. The proposed set of  measures of local agency power over decision-making was tested  empirically in Florida. Its applicability as an indicator of  governmental decentralization was investigated by contrasting the model  with measures of decentralization proposed by previous studies. The  proposed empirical measures succeed in: 1) analyzing decentralization  from below by dealing with local governments as disaggregated units, 2)  demonstrating the variation in levels of power across Florida’s  municipalities, and 3) providing a comprehensive picture of  decentralization by capturing its economic, political, and  administrative dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research indicates that Florida’s growth management system has  shaped the structure of power over decision-making for comprehensive  planning. The Department of Community Affairs (DCA) has been given a  dominant role in the process of local planning. Regional planning  councils (RPCs) have no power over decision-making despite their  responsibilities as technical assistants, facilitators, and negotiators.  Local governments have been required to prepare local comprehensive  plans/plan amendments consistent with state and regional plans.  Sanctions are used to ensure local compliance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xiv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with state requirements and standards. Therefore, the growth management  system of Florida has reduced the power of local governments over  decision-making for comprehensive planning, which increases levels of  centralization in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research fills partially a gap in the literature of international  development planning by presenting a tool to analyze decentralization  from below, which enables us to design better strategies to establish  decentralization at the local level. The research also contributes to  the field of growth management by providing empirical measures of local  agency power over decision-making for comprehensive planning. These  measures should be addressed in policy analysis of growth management in  order to improve planning systems and practices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
