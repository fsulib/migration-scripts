The concepts in the study consisted of  complex defined concepts from a highly technical domain. Eleven students  in a graduate instructional design program were assigned via stratified  groups to one of two instructional treatment groups, one  concept-focused and one procedures-focused. Learners in the  Concept-Focused Group received conceptual relational database design  instruction early in the instructional sequence, prior to procedural  instruction. Learners in the Procedures-Focused Group were presented the  identical conceptual information, but embedded throughout an  instructional sequence that emphasized procedural knowledge. Significant  positive differences were found for far transfer performance and  motivation levels in learners between the two groups. Verbal protocol  analysis revealed no differences in time or trial and error strategies  learners in the two groups took to solve a far transfer problem. These  findings suggest that a concept-focused instructional strategy can  positively impact student learning and motivation when learning complex  defined concepts, and can assist learners in developing a more accurate  mental model of these complex concepts. Suggestions for future research  are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
